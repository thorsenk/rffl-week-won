# RFFL Week 1 Median Webapp - Project Summary

## 🎯 Project Overview

Successfully built a comprehensive Week 1 median scoring webapp for the RFFL fantasy football league. This webapp serves as the **official source** for Week 1 results where teams compete against the league median instead of traditional head-to-head matchups.

## ✅ Completed Features

### Core Median System
- **Median Calculation Engine**: Sorts 12 team scores high→low, calculates median as average of 6th & 7th place
- **Real-time Results**: Win/Loss/Tie determination based on score vs median comparison
- **Visual Indicators**: Color-coded team status with margin calculations
- **Statistics Tracking**: Win/loss counts, score ranges, median performance metrics

### User Interface
- **Mobile-First Design**: Responsive layout optimized for phone viewing
- **Interactive Team Grid**: Clickable team boxes showing median status
- **Detailed Team Views**: Individual team breakdowns with player data
- **League Standings**: Complete rankings table with median comparisons
- **Advanced Charts**: Score distribution and median performance visualizations

### RFFL Integration
- **Canonical Team Mapping**: Symlinked to main CLI project data files
- **Alias Resolution**: Handles team name variations across seasons
- **Co-ownership Support**: Proper display of shared team ownership
- **Historical Context**: Week 1 performance vs historical averages
- **Lineup Validation**: RFFL compliance checking (1 QB, 2 RB, 2 WR, 1 TE, 1 FLEX, 1 D/ST, 1 K)

### Technical Features
- **ESPN API Integration**: Structured for live data fetching (sample data for now)
- **Caching System**: 5-minute cache intervals to optimize performance
- **Real-time Updates**: Auto-refresh during live games
- **AI Recap Generation**: Gemini API integration for narrative summaries
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks and user-friendly error messages

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Frontend Stack
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: No framework dependencies, modern ES6+ features
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first styling via CDN
- **Chart.js**: Professional data visualization
- **Custom CSS**: Enhanced animations and mobile optimizations

### Data Flow
```
ESPN API → Sample Data → RFFL Enrichment → Median Calculator → UI Components
     ↓
Canonical Mapping (symlinked files) → Team Identity Resolution → Display Formatting
```

### Key Components

1. **median-calculator.js**: Core median calculation logic following RFFL rules
2. **espn-api.js**: ESPN integration layer with fallback to sample data  
3. **rffl-data.js**: RFFL business logic, team mapping, lineup validation
4. **main.js**: Primary application coordinator and UI management

## 🚀 How to Use

### Development
```bash
cd rffl-week1-webapp
./serve.sh
```
Then open http://localhost:8000

### Testing
Visit http://localhost:8000/test.html to verify all systems are working

### Production Deployment
- Upload to any static hosting (Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages)
- Configure ESPN API credentials in `config/espn-config.json`
- Add Gemini API key for AI recap generation
- Ensure HTTPS (required for ESPN API)

## 🎮 User Experience

### Mobile-Optimized
- Touch-friendly team selection
- Responsive grid layouts
- Optimized for portrait phone viewing
- Fast loading with minimal dependencies

### Accessibility

- Smooth animations and transitions
- Professional data visualizations

## 🔌 Integration Points

### With RFFL CLI Project
- **Data Symlinks**: Automatically syncs team identity changes
- **Business Logic Consistency**: Matches CLI rounding and validation rules
- **Historical Context**: References 14+ years of RFFL data

### With ESPN
- **API Structure**: Ready for live ESPN integration
- **Authentication**: Supports private league cookies (ESPN_S2, SWID)

- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback if API unavailable

## 📊 Sample Data & Testing

The webapp includes realistic sample data based on RFFL's Week 1 historical average (97.41):

- 12 teams with varied scores (124.20 down to 74.42)
- Calculated median: 95.85 (average of 6th: 97.40, 7th: 94.30)
- Results: 6 wins, 6 losses, 0 ties
- Demonstrates full median logic and edge cases

## 🔮 Future Enhancements
